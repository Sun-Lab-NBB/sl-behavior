## Detailed Description

This library extracts and processes data from .npz log archives generated by the
[sl-experiment library](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-experiment). It saves extracted data as uncompressed .feather
files that are later integrated into unified project datasets using assets from the
[sl-forgery library](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-forgery).

The library supports two primary usage modes:

- **Remote processing**: Called via bindings in sl-forgery and run on remote compute servers for large-scale batch
  processing.
- **Local processing**: Called via CLI or MCP server for processing individual sessions or smaller batches on local
  machines.

## Dependencies

For users, all library dependencies are installed automatically by all supported installation methods
(see the [Installation](#installation) section).

***Note!*** Developers should see the [Developers](#developers) section for information on installing additional
development dependencies.

___

## Installation

### Source

Note, installation from source is ***highly discouraged*** for anyone who is not an active project developer.

1. Download this repository to the local machine using the preferred method, such as git-cloning. Use one of the
   [stable releases](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-behavior/releases) that include precompiled binary and
   source code distribution (sdist) wheels.
2. If the downloaded distribution is stored as a compressed archive, unpack it using the appropriate decompression tool.
3. ```cd``` to the root directory of the prepared project distribution.
4. Run ```python -m pip install .``` to install the project. Alternatively, if using a distribution with precompiled
   binaries, use ```python -m pip install WHEEL_PATH```, replacing 'WHEEL_PATH' with the path to the wheel file.

### pip

Use the following command to install the library using pip: ```pip install sl-behavior```.

## Usage

### Remote Processing

The library is primarily designed for use on remote compute servers via bindings in the
[sl-forgery library](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-forgery). Due to the centralized approach to data collection and
processing in the lab, all experiment and training sessions require processing with this library.

### CLI Processing

The library can process sessions locally using the `sl-behavior process` CLI command:

```bash
sl-behavior process --session-path /path/to/session --runtime --face-camera --body-camera --actor --sensor --encoder
```

Use `sl-behavior process --help` to see all available options.

### MCP Server

This library provides an MCP server that exposes behavior data processing tools for AI agent integration. The server
enables agents to discover sessions, start batch processing with automatic queuing, and monitor progress.

#### Starting the Server

Start the MCP server using the CLI:

```bash
sl-behavior mcp
```

#### Available Tools

| Tool                         | Description                                                             |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `discover_sessions_tool`     | Finds processable sessions under a root directory                       |
| `start_processing_tool`      | Starts batch processing for one or more sessions with automatic queuing |
| `get_processing_status_tool` | Returns status for all sessions being managed                           |

The `discover_sessions_tool` automatically filters out non-processable session types and returns only sessions that
contain behavior data (lick training, run training, and mesoscope experiment sessions).

#### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add the following to the Claude Desktop configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sl-behavior": {
      "command": "sl-behavior",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## API Documentation

See the [API documentation](https://sl-behavior-api-docs.netlify.app/) for the
detailed description of the methods and classes exposed by components of this library.

**Note!** The API documentation includes important information about Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) exposed by this
library as part of installation into a Python environment.

___

## Developers

This section provides installation, dependency, and build-system instructions for project developers.

### Installing the Project

***Note!*** This installation method requires **mamba version 2.3.2 or above**. Currently, all Sun lab automation
pipelines require that mamba is installed through the [miniforge3](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) installer.

1. Download this repository to the local machine using the preferred method, such as git-cloning.
2. If the downloaded distribution is stored as a compressed archive, unpack it using the appropriate decompression tool.
3. ```cd``` to the root directory of the prepared project distribution.
4. Install the core Sun lab development dependencies into the ***base*** mamba environment via the
   ```mamba install tox uv tox-uv``` command.
5. Use the ```tox -e create``` command to create the project-specific development environment followed by
   ```tox -e install``` command to install the project into that environment as a library.

### Additional Dependencies

In addition to installing the project and all user dependencies, install the following dependencies:

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) distributions, one for each version supported by the developed project.
   Currently, this library supports the three latest stable versions. It is recommended to use a tool like
   [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install and manage the required versions.

### Development Automation

This project comes with a fully configured set of automation pipelines implemented using
[tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/user_guide.html). Check the [tox.ini file](tox.ini) for details about the
available pipelines and their implementation. Alternatively, call ```tox list``` from the root directory of the project
to see the list of available tasks.

**Note!** All pull requests for this project have to successfully complete the ```tox``` task before being merged.
To expedite the task’s runtime, use the ```tox --parallel``` command to run some tasks in-parallel.

### Automation Troubleshooting

Many packages used in 'tox' automation pipelines (uv, mypy, ruff) and 'tox' itself may experience runtime failures. In
most cases, this is related to their caching behavior. If an unintelligible error is encountered with
any of the automation components, deleting the corresponding .cache (.tox, .ruff_cache, .mypy_cache, etc.) manually
or via a CLI command typically solves the issue.
